## Approach & Solution

### User Interface
- Focus was placed on designing pixel-perfect UI screens, replicating the designs provided in the Figma file.
- All pages were designed to be user-friendly, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.
- I utilized **Next.js** for fast and optimized React rendering, ensuring an excellent user experience even on slower connections.

### Code & Structure
- I followed best practices for clean and maintainable code.
- The application utilizes **CSS Modules** for component-level styles, ensuring scoped and reusable styles.
- **Styled Components** were used for dynamic styling based on state.

### Challenges & Solutions
- One challenge was ensuring the pixel-perfect match with the Figma design. I used tools like **Figma Inspect** to closely match the typography, spacing, and colors.
- I had to pay special attention to the responsive layout to ensure it works across all screen sizes.
